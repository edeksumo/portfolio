      This is where the images in the gallery live. Here's a simple gallery image for you to copy:

      Full Width Image:

          <img src="../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">
          <span class="image-caption">IMAGE_CAPTION</span>

      Half Width Image:

          <img src="../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">
          <span class="image-caption">IMAGE_CAPTION</span>
        </div>

      - To add an image to the this area, copy one of the above, paste it below this comment, and change the following:
          - IMAGE_NAME: the name of the image file in assets/images
          - IMAGE_CAPTION: to the caption of the image
