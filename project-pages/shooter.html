              This is where the images in the gallery live. Here's a simple gallery image for you to copy:

              Full Width Image:

                <div class="gallery-image-container">
                  <img src="../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">

              Half Width Image:

                <div class="gallery-image-container half-width">
                  <img src="../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">

                </div>

              - To add an image to the this area, copy one of the above, paste it below this comment, and change the following:
                  - IMAGE_NAME: the name of the image file in assets/images
                  - IMAGE_CAPTION: to the caption of the image
